# Install GLPI about ANsible Playbook

In this example, the playbook installs MariaDB, \ 
configures the root password, creates a new database for GLPI, installs GLPI, \
and configures the necessary permissions and ownership. \
\
Please note that you may need to adjust the path and the version number of the GLPI \
package according to your environment. Also, you may want to update the mariadb_root_password \
to a more secure password, and also make sure that the version of GLPI is the one you want to install. \

Please make sure that you have a proper backup of your data before running this script, as it may make changes to your system. \
